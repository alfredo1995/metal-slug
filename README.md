NOTE: The 100 MB file size limit set by GitHub has been exceeded for this project.

    To solve this problem, I used Git LFS (Git Large File Storage):

Git LFS was configured to track files in the "library" and "assets" folders and store them externally.

    git lfs install 

    git lfs track "libary/*" 
    git lfs track "Assets/*" 
    
This project requires some libraries to function correctly. Follow the steps below:

    Make sure you have the following libraries installed on your system:

    - Biblioteca Assets
    - Biblioteca Libary

Folder configuration "Libary"

    1. Clone this repository to your system.
    2. Navigate to the project's "library" folder: `cd Library`.
    3. Install the dependencies in the "library" folder by running the command: `npm install`.

Running the project

    1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project root.
    2. Run the command `npm start` to start the project.

Repeat the procedure for the "Assets" folder.
