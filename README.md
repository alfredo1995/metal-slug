# MetalSlug

Recreated the classic arcade action game (Metal Slug) in 2D style (Run and Gun) developed in the Unity Engine.

This game is capable of storing and displaying a lot of information simultaneously. Lots of animations, exaggerated explosions, lots of on-screen elements and big enemies.

The game also has its style of humor that makes even enemy deaths a little comical.

Implemented the use of Object Pooling (creation design pattern) to optimize my project and deal with markers that are being instantiated frequently.
