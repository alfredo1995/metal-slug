# MetalSlug

This is a small prototype of this Run and Gun style game, Metal Slug, it is capable of storing and displaying a lot of information simultaneously.


I've eliminated the need to create new bullets (objects) or destroy old ones while the game is running, to drastically reduce the load placed on the CPU when creating and destroying GameObjects quickly

At the link below you can play the full version with bug fixes and implementation of new features.
